# Computer Archtiture
## The question of the course:
  *How to build a computer from scratch?*

This course is considered in my opinion as the most important course in the semester. It consists of 3 main parts:
* Numbering systems (language of the computer)
* Logic circuits 
  * combinational circuits
  * Sequential circuits 
  * Memory and Register
* Computer Organization (How memory, registers, and different studied components build up a computer)
  "You will learn the concept of black boxing and using small components to build big products"

## Notes to be Considered:
* Attend all lectures as possible as U can however you will feel that you don't understand anything.
* Try to prepare for the lecture at least look at the Slides
* First part seems to be easy but has a lot of details and you can apply on it by solving problems
* I have found some useful material about the first part numbering systems from Universty of Princeton:
  * https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr19/cos217/lectures/05_NumberSystems.pdf
* You don't need to understand every detail in the begining topics will be clearer throw the course
* Alyways ask the Prof and the Teaching Assestant
* Last
